# Coding Rules

Describe rules to be followed in coding.

1. Indentation is four spaces.
2. Documentation in classes, functions, and files
    - Describe as much as possible, including arguments, returns, possible exceptions, etc.
3. Create unit tests for functions and tests.
4. For naming, emphasis should be placed on clarity, and some lengthening of the name is acceptable.
    - For instance:
        - For user information
            - info (not good)
            - userInfo (great)
